In Mexico, unfavorable sociodemographic conditions have increased the vulnerability of some sectors of the population to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is necessary to detect and make visible which sociodemographic factors are linked to higher rates of sars-cov2 infection and mortality, and thus to have a basis for generating public policies to reduce such vulnerability.

For this purpose, in this workshop we will use different mathematical methods such as linear regression by least squares and gradient boosting methods of variable selection and hypothesis testing applied to open data from covid-19 in Mexico and from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI).

In this workshop we'll guide you through the Data Science development lifecycle to answer a research question using open national census data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI).
